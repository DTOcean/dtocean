# DTOcean

**DTOcean is an open-source tool for design and techno-economic assessment of
marine renewable energy arrays.**

DTOcean can calculate:

* Optimal ocean energy converter (OEC) positioning
* Energy export infrastructure
* Station keeping requirements based on OEC performance and site conditions
* Installation planning with weather effects
* Maintenance planning, simulating OEC downtime
* Environmental impact assessment (experimental)

And features include:

* A unique statistical approach to calculating levelized cost of energy (LCOE)
* OEC reliability influenced at component level
* Graphical user interface
* Persistent database
* Wizard based installation (for Windows)

This repository contains DTOcean installation wizards and can also be
used for submitting and tracking issues.

 * For 64 and 32-bit Windows only.

This version of DTOcean was developed and published by Mathew Topper at [Data
Only Greater](https://www.dataonlygreater.com/) as a continuation of the
[EU FP7 DTOcean project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/608597).

Also, please check out the [EU H2020 DTOceanPlus project](
https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/featured-projects/dtoceanplus_en), which
expanded the scope of the DTOcean tools. The source code for DTOceanPlus is
available [here](https://gitlab.com/dtoceanplus).

## Installation
