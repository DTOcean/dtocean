        Note:
          Currently only inputs marked as optional have any logical effect.

          appear in the declare_inputs output. For example::

              optional = ["My:first:variable",

        the data description or interface from effecting the other.

        Returns:
          dict: Mapping of local to data description variable identifiers

        Example:
          The returned value must be a dictionary containing all the inputs and
          outputs from the data description and a local alias string. For
          example::
